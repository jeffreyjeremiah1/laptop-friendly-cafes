# Laptop Friendly Cafes

This is a web app made with python that allows users to search for cafes with good wifi within a specific location. The app displays a list of cafes with their corresponding names, locations, and open hours. It allows users to add new cafes to the list and rate them based on their wifi quality. The app stores all this information in a database, making it easy for users to access and update the information as needed. The app is useful for people who frequently need to work remotely or have other wifi-dependent tasks to do while on the go and helps them find the best places to do so.
